# Dotfiles üíª

Goals of this repo:

- Single repo.
- Backed by `git`.
- Powered entirely by Ansible with no other tooling.
- Does not need to be cloned to a specific location to work.

## Automatic Setup with Ansible üçÉ

The Ansible script currently supports macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and openSUSE (Tumbleweed).

Note, whether you are doing an automatic setup with Ansible or a manual setup it pays to first, [fork](https://github.com/chopfitzroy/dotfiles-experiment/fork) this repository to your own GitHub account.

Clone the repository using the following command **substituting in your new repository address**:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:user/repo.git
```

Update the `git_repo` value in `vars/generic.yml` to reflect your new repository address.

### Setup for openSUSE ü¶é

Install `ansible` with the following command:

```sh
sudo zypper install ansible
```

### Setup for macOS üçè

Install `ansible` with the following command:

```sh
brew install ansible
```

### Funll install ‚ö°

Run the **entire** playbook with the following command **in the project directory**:

```sh
ansible-playbook main.yml --ask-become-pass
```


### Partial installs ‚õÖ

In the event that you to perform a partial installation you can mask use of [Ansible tags](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_tags.html). An example of what this might look like:

```sh
ansible-playbook main.yml --tags "asdf,node,deno" --ask-become-pass
```

Please refer to `main.yml` to get an understanding of which tags are available.

## Synchronising changes üîÅ

The Ansible scripts have been designed to be deterministic meaning you can run them an infinite number of times and they should always work.

Synchronising latest changes can always be done using the following command:

```sh
ansible-playbook main.yml --ask-become-pass
```

Alternatively if you just have config changes a faster option is:

```sh
ansible-playbook main.yml --tags "rsync,config" --ask-become-pass
```

Or use `config-{{ name }}` to update only one config:

```sh
ansible-playbook main.yml --tags "rsync,config-helix" --ask-become-pass
```

**NOTE:** `rsync` installs a required package for Ansible synchronize, if it is already installed you can omit this tag.

## Language support üí¨

If running the Ansible scripts the following software will be installed:

- [Go](https://go.dev/) and it's LSP [`gopls`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and it's LSP [`typescript-language-server`](https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server)
- [Deno](https://deno.land/) which uses the same LSP as Node.
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and it's LSP [`solargraph`](https://solargraph.org/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and it's LSP [`rust-analyzer`](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) via [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/)

Finally we utilize [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) for languages that do not have an _official_ way to manage versions.

### Known issues üí£

- asdf uses [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) under the hood, this has strict [build requirements](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build/wiki) which differ from system to system, so if you see any errors I recommend starting here.
 
## Reasoning üîÆ

Below are some _brief_ reasonings behind each software I have chosen to use.

### Command line utilities ‚ö°

There are a large number of command line utilities being developed by the open source community. Below is a list of all of the utilities included in this repo.

- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [exa](https://the.exa.website/)
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- [nap](https://github.com/maaslalani/nap)
- [vhs](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs)
- [xplr](https://github.com/sayanarijit/xplr)
- [focus](https://github.com/ayoisaiah/focus)
- [gitui](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui)
- [slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides)
- [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
- [Silicon](https://github.com/Aloxaf/silicon)
- [Starship](https://starship.rs/)
- [Sheldon](https://github.com/rossmacarthur/sheldon)
- [Tealdeer](https://dbrgn.github.io/tealdeer/)

### Editor üß¨

[Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) is a [Kakoune](https://kakoune.org/) inspired text editor. It is a modal editor similar to Vim but has some key differences.

Helix completely removes the need to manage editor plugins, this provides long term productivity payoffs and removes a lot of the headaches associated with dotfile management.

If you want to learn more about Helix I recommend this [overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHebvTGOdH8) and if you want something more hands on I highly recommend this [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@LukePighetti/featured).

If you are a die hard [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) user but like the sound of not needing to manage your plugins I strongly recommend [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/).

### Zsh üêö

The primary reason for using Zsh over something like [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) is that Zsh is Bash compatiable, meaning it _just works_ with a lot of tools I already use.
 
[Sheldon](https://sheldon.cli.rs/) plugin manager keeps the plugin config _outside_ of the `.zshrc`, this creates a clear separation between what is my config and what is plugins.

[Starship](https://starship.rs/) keeps the prompt config outside of the `.zshrc`, additionally it supports a number of different shells meaning if I ever switch shells I can likely bring this with me.

### Terminal üß∂

[WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) has a number of features that make it particularily appealing, some of the primary reasons are:

- It works well with WSL 2.
- It works on macOS, Linux and Windows.
- It has fallback font support which allows me to use any font I like with [nerd fonts symbols](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/faq/#kitty-is-not-able-to-use-my-favorite-font).
- It has a built in multiplexer which prevents some [historic issues](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/391#issuecomment-638320745) associated with using multiplexers.

Special mention to [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/) which I would be using as a multiplexer if WezTerm did not package it's own.

## Theming üåà

Theming is hugely personal but below are some notes to get you started.

### Fonts üÜé

Below are a number of fonts I have used (or wanted to use) over the years, I have split them into _premium_ meaning there is a cost associated with them and _free_ meaning they can be used for personal use (or in some cases commercial use) at no cost.

**Premium:**

- [Gintronic](https://markfromberg.com/projects/gintronic/)
- [MonoLisa](https://www.monolisa.dev/)
- [Dank Mono](https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono)
- [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator)
- [Berkeley Mono Typeface](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/)

I use [Berkeley Mono Typeface](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/) exclusively these days and absolutely love it. Yes I paid the $75.00 and it was worth every penny.

**Free:**

- [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/)
- [Input Mono](https://input.djr.com/)
- [Cascadia Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/cascadia-code)
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
- [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/source-code-pro)

### Color scheme üé®

If you are like me and you want all your application to use the same color scheme there are a couple of limitations you need to be aware of.

Essentially there are 5 applications you need to theme `fzf`, `bat`, `nap`, Helix, and WezTerm. These all have their own theme engines so you are effectively limited to themes **supported by all 5 applications**.

Here are some tips for finding themes for each application:

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is the hardest by far, some themes include `fzf` snippets in their docs if your lucky, I have however had a lot of success with [base16-fzf](https://github.com/tinted-theming/base16-fzf) which includes a lot of modern themes.
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) comes with a number of themes out of the box use `bat --list-themes` to view installed themes. Fourtunately `bat` use `.tmTheme` themes meaning any [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) theme will work with `bat`, the Ansible script will install a few extra `bat` themes for you.
- [nap](https://github.com/maaslalani/nap) uses [chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) under the hook, check the `styles/` directory to check available themes.
- [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) ships with a number of themes use `:theme` to view installed themes, I have noticed that the quality of themes tends to vary so I recommend trying a theme for a few hours before committing.
- [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) ships with over 700 themes and is usually easy to match up with everything else, browse the [online directory](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/colorschemes/index.html) to find the theme for you.

## Future Improvements üéâ

Below are a list of future improvements I would like to make to this repository.

- Setup [`artempyanykh/marksman`](https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman) for working with markdown files. 
- Setup [`vadimcn/vscode-lldb`](https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb) to work with Rust LSP. Pending this [issue](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/4231).
- Setup [`teaxyz/cli`](https://github.com/teaxyz/cli) once it is a bit more mature.
- Setup [`zyedidia/eget`](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget) for GitHub downloads.
- Setup [`valentjn/ltex-ls`](https://github.com/valentjn/ltex-ls) for grammer checks. [More information](https://microblog.desipenguin.com/post/grammar-check-with-helix-editor/).

## Gotchas ‚ö†

Below are some common gotchas and how to fix them.

### GitHub API limit üí•

It is possible to hit the upper limit of GitHub API interactions if the Ansible playbook is being run repeatedly.

You can get around this by running the following command **substituting in your own token**:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=token_value; ansible-playbook main.yml --ask-become-pass
```

### asdf reshim üó°

When installing global packages (i.e with `npm`) these packages will not be [reshimmed](https://asdf-vm.com/manage/core.html#reshim) automatically.

To reshim all packages run:

```bash
asdf reshim
```

## Experiments üß™

Below are some of the experiments that I have tried over the years either didn't make it into my dotfiles or were removed.

### Terminal docs üßæ

I really wanted a terminal based workflow for quickly looking up language documentation when needed.

I tried both [`cht.sh`](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh) and [`dasht`](https://github.com/sunaku/dasht) but neither really stuck in the way I wanted.

For now I have setup a [custom search engine](https://zapier.com/blog/add-search-engine-to-chrome/) for [devdocs.io](https://devdocs.io/) which is still relatively fast and has the advantage of correctly rendering the MDN examples.

If you want to do this yourself the URL you will need is below, note `%s` refers to the search term placeholder.

```
https://devdocs.io/#q=%s
```

In the future I would like to explore doing something like [this](https://eseth.org/2020/devdocs-cli.html) for a more terminal centric workflow.

### Markdown knowledge base üß†

I originally tried to create my own markdown knowledge base rendered in the terminal via [Glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow).

Unfortunately this didn't quite have the flow I wanted. Since then I have discovered [Silver Bullet](https://silverbullet.md/) which is more browser centric workflow and has been working well so far.

If you are interested in building your own knowledge base here is [mine](https://github.com/chopfitzroy/knowledgebase).
